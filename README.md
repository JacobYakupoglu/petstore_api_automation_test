Task 1

I used Rest-Assured, TestNG and Hamcrest frameworks for PetStore API Test Automation Project and I added them to pom.xml file as a dependency
I used Rest-Assured Framework because I wrote my test cases using cucumber style
I used TestNG framework for test annotations
I used Hamcrest framework for assertions
I automated Pet Store APIs
I wrote 3 positive and 3 negative test cases for test automation
I had difficult time when I was automating APIs, because I could get 200 ok on my first try, but I was getting error on my second try. APIs were not stable.

Task 2

I created 3 improvement points for wikipedia website.
